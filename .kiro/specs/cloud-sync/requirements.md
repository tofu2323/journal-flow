# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement cloud synchronization for the journal application to enable cross-device access and data backup. Users will be able to access their journals from multiple devices (PC and smartphone) and have their data safely backed up in the cloud to prevent data loss.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a journal user, I want my journal entries to be synchronized across all my devices, so that I can write and read my journals from both my PC and smartphone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a journal entry on one device THEN the system SHALL synchronize the entry to all other connected devices within 30 seconds
2. WHEN a user edits an existing journal entry THEN the system SHALL update the entry across all devices
3. WHEN a user deletes a journal entry THEN the system SHALL remove the entry from all connected devices
4. WHEN a user opens the application on any device THEN the system SHALL display the most recent version of all journal entries

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a journal user, I want my data to be automatically backed up to the cloud, so that I don't lose my journal entries if my device is damaged or lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates or modifies journal data THEN the system SHALL automatically backup the data to cloud storage
2. WHEN a user's local data is corrupted or lost THEN the system SHALL restore all journal entries from the cloud backup
3. WHEN the system performs a backup THEN it SHALL maintain data integrity and completeness
4. WHEN a backup operation fails THEN the system SHALL retry the operation and notify the user if it continues to fail

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a journal user, I want to authenticate securely to access my cloud-synced journals, so that my personal data remains private and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first uses the cloud sync feature THEN the system SHALL require secure authentication
2. WHEN a user authenticates successfully THEN the system SHALL provide access to their personal journal data only
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL deny access to cloud data and provide appropriate error messaging
4. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication before accessing cloud data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a journal user, I want the application to work offline and sync when connectivity is restored, so that I can continue journaling even without internet access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the device is offline THEN the system SHALL allow users to create, edit, and delete journal entries locally
2. WHEN internet connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically synchronize all offline changes to the cloud
3. WHEN there are conflicting changes between local and cloud data THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts using a last-write-wins strategy
4. WHEN sync is in progress THEN the system SHALL display sync status to the user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a journal user, I want to see the sync status of my data, so that I know when my entries are safely backed up and synchronized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is being synchronized THEN the system SHALL display a sync indicator showing progress
2. WHEN synchronization is complete THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation that data is up to date
3. WHEN synchronization fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with retry options
4. WHEN the device is offline THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate offline status and pending sync items
